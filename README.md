# dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles. This will expand every once in a while.

Some of these are modified to work on (almost) any environment, though some are modified
to remove possibly sensitive/user-specific information.

Here's a list of programs you'll need to use these at the greatest level:
- radare2
- gdb
- pwndbg
- nano-syntax-highlighting
- ripgrep
- lsd
- fish
- kitty
- neofetch

If you find any issues with these or a program I forgot to mention, feel free to make an issue.
